#Mynecraft (Final Project)#

###Project Description###

Our project is going to be similar to the well-known game Minecraft. Mynecraft is going to have random level generation made up of environmental cube blocks. The player can then explore this environment and see the different biomes contained within it. We also hope to include some AI animials that players can interact.

This game is primarily focused on level generation. To generate the maps we are using Perlin Noise to randomly create the enviroments. As a player begins to explore the map, more terrain is randomly generated. As terrain is generated, biomes will also be generated. These biomes could be deserts, mountains, plains, snowy, etc. A player will never have the same experience twice.
